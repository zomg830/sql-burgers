#Description

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will be devoured and moved into the devoured section.
